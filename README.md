# SortingAlgorithms

This training app was made for educational purposes to practice implementing simple algorithms.
In this app was implemented such searching and sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Merge sort, Linear and Binary search. It was implemented with the help of interfaces for each type of algorithm and helpers (the first one creates arrays and the second one check if the array is sorted).

Here you can see a class diagram of the application:
